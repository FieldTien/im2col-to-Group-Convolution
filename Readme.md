# im2col to Group Convolution 
## Introduction
im2col is the method of implement Convolution layers to matrix inner product form,  it spent more memory but the matrix prduct form is easier to parallelize in GPU.

Here, we will quickly review the nomal Convolution(group=1) by using im2col.
And extend the im2col to group convolution.

The review is following from the [article ](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/63974249)
